        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">A Bit About Me</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-2">
          I have a keen interest in exploring the ever-evolving world of
          technology, particularly in software development and the MERN stack
          (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). As a self-taught web
          developer, I'm constantly honing my skills and diving deeper into the
          intricacies of building modern web applications.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-2">
          Beyond the realm of code, I'm fascinated by the wonders of
          biotechnology and bioinformatics. The intersection of biology and
          technology opens up a realm of possibilities, from understanding the
          complexities of life to developing innovative solutions for healthcare
          and beyond.

          learnings with fellow enthusiasts and aspiring learners.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-2">
          Whether it's delving into the latest trends in software development,
          exploring the frontiers of biotech research, or documenting my own
